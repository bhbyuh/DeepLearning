# Potato Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

## Introduction
This repository focuses on classifying potato diseases using images, employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and differentiate between healthy and diseased potatoes. It is designed to assist farmers or agricultural professionals in quickly diagnosing diseases for effective crop management.

## Description
The project utilizes deep learning techniques for image classification. The dataset comprises labeled images of potato leaves, which include various disease categories and healthy samples. By training a CNN model, the system predicts the category of a given image with high accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Disease Detection:** Classifies potato leaf images into categories such as "Healthy" or "Diseased."
- **Deep Learning Implementation:** Uses CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.
- **TensorFlow Framework:** Built using TensorFlow for model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - NumPy and Pandas (for data handling)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How It Works
1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - The dataset contains images of potato leaves, divided into training, and test sets.
   - Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) to ensure compatibility with the CNN model.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented using TensorFlow.
   - Layers include convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.

3. **Training and Validation:**
   - The model is trained using labeled data and evaluated on a validation set to optimize performance.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Once trained, the model predicts the category of a given image (e.g., "Healthy," "Blight," "Scab").
